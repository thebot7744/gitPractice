Description: Docu
        ====
        
        `Docu` is a lightweight schema/query framework for document databases.
        It is not an ORM as it doesn't map existing schemata to Python objects but
        instead defines them on a higher layer built upon a schema-less storage
        (key/value or document-oriented). You define models as a valuable subset of the
        whole database and work with only certain parts of existing entities â€”  the
        parts that you need.
